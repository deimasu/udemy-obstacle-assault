# Obstacle Assault (UE5 Learning Project)

## Description
This is the second UE5 project created by me as part of the Udemy UE5 game development course. This project involves creating a C++ class for the obstacles in the game, which has functionality for moving and rotating objects derived from this class. In this game, players should overcome the obstacles on the way to the top of the map to obtain treasures.

## What I've Learned
- Creating C++ classes for UE
- Creating Blueprint child classes of C++
- Logging in UE
- UE data types (FString, FVector, FRotator)
- Using GameMode and Character classes
- Adding and customizing Kill Volumes
- Adding sounds to the game (animation sounds, scene sounds, randomization of the sound, sounds on an event)
- Working with Sound Mix and Sound Class
- Creating the main menu for the game (with ability to change display settings of the game)
- Implementing restart with respawn
- Adding a win condition to the game
- Working with foliage
